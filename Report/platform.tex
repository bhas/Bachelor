\section{Game Engine}
The choice to implement the functions discussed in this bachelor thesis fell on the programming language Java as this is what we are most comfortable in and would rather use our time working on the interesting problem than trying to find pros and cons of the different types of programming language.
The platform for which we test our solutions on are based on a project by Oscar Stigter. Oscar have made a free to use source code which furfilled the most of our requirements. The ground principles that Oscar had implemented have been used in a new project to create a platform that we are proud of and fully comfortable with using in our bachelor thesis.

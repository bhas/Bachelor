\section{Determine the strength of a poker hand}
Our first step towards developing an adaptive poker is to finding a way to determine the strength of any given hand in any game state. In this chapter we will answer the question: 

\begin{center}
How can we predict the probability of ending up with the winning hand?
\end{center}

Since you don't know the outcome of the community cards during a round of poker you have to estimate your chance of winning based on the possible outcomes. The problem is that there are more than 250 millions different outcomes of community cards alone. Additionally the poker rules are quite complex when it comes to determining the wining hand so it's almost impossible to make a formula to calculate the exact probability. So how do you find the probability without having to check the outcome of 250 millions hands? 
The solution is to find an estimate instead of an exact probability.

\subsection{Design}
When solving this problem we have two options.

One way is to create a simplified formula to estimate the strength of the hand. The Chen formula is an example of this. This method is really simple to calculate but also less accurate.

Another way is to use the Monte Carlo method to simulate a lot of games and get an estimate of the probability. The more simulations you perform the more accurate the estimate you get.

For a human player the simplified formula would work best but in our case the Monte Carlo method is best suited. This is because a computer has no problem performing a lot of advanced computations. This method also gives the trade-off between accuracy and computations which allows us to decide how accurate we need the estimate. Other poker computers also uses this method.\\

We have developed our own subsystem to perform the simulations and return a probability of winning. We will refer to this subsystem as the calculator. It takes three arguments: the whole cards of the player, the community cards (optional) and the number of opponents. The calculator then performs the simulations and returns an object containing the distribution of outcomes.

Our requirements for the calculator are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It shall be able to return the probability of winning for any poker state with up to ten players.
\item It must have a maximum error of one percent (deviation from caniwin\cite{caniwin}).
\item It shall calculate the probability in less than five seconds.
\end{enumerate}

To find the right amount of simulations we tested the calculator with different numbers of simulations. From our tests we found that 50.000 simulations is the number of simulations best suited for the calculator.

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo method}
The Monte Carlo method can be used to calculate a distribution of results for a domain. This is done by creating a large amount of simulations with random inputs within a range of allowed inputs and note down the results of each simulation. These simulations are also called Monte Carlo simulations. The distribution of results can be used to find the likelihood of possible outcomes. The more simulations that are performed the more accurate the probabilities will get.

\subsection{Test}
To test if our subsystem calculates the correct probabilities we find the probability of a number of different pre-flop scenarios and compare the result to the results of caniwin. Every test have been preformed with 50.000 simulations against one opponent. The result can be seen in table \ref{tab:pre-flop-test}.

We also test the accuracy of our Monte Carlo using different numbers of simulations. Figure \ref{fig:mc1}, \ref{fig:mc10} and \ref{fig:mc50} shows the distribution of results from 50 tests. Each test is performed with a pair of jacks in pre-flop with one opponent. Caniwin found the probability to be 77,1 \%. 

In table \ref{tab:mc-total} you can see the total result. The range is the difference between the lowest and highest result and the max error is the maximum deviation from caniwin.

We settled for 50.000 as the number of simulations for our calculator. This satisfies our requirements.

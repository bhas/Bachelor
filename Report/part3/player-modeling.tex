\section{Learning to adapt to opponents}
\label{sec:part3}

In the previous chapter we created an algorithm to develop the default strategy for the APC. The default strategy is one of the two strategies that will be used to determine the actions of the APC. The other strategy is the adaptive strategy. \\

The goal of this chapter is to learn the APC to create an algorithm to develop the adaptive strategy by solving problem statement 3.

In poker there is no such thing as a single optimal strategy. Every strategy has weaknesses and therefore the optimal strategy is one that takes advantage of the weaknesses of the strategies of the opponents. In order to take advantage of the opponents strategies one must first understand their strategy. In poker understanding the opponents is one of the most important key elements of the game. 

Once one understand the strategy of the opponent one has to adapt oneself's strategy.



\subsubsection{Player modeling}
Player modeling is a loosely defined concept and may vary from one context to another. The concept of player modeling is to make a computational model of a player. This model includes game related attributes, such as play style and preferences, as well as non-game related attributes, such as cultural background, gender, and personality. All decisions of the player are ultimately made on the basis of these attributes. 

Player modeling is used to describe or predict the players decisions, reasoning and reactions. In the field of artificial intelligences the human player is the most used model for developing computer players. Understanding the reason behind every choice of a player will not only bring a better understanding of the player but also a better understanding of the game and its mechanics.

Since the player model can easily become extremely extensive one normally only includes the relevant attributes of the player.

\subsection{How can we model a player dynamically?}
To player model each player the system has to look at the previous history of the games while dynamic learning as the game proceeds.
This can be implemented using a neural network and will help us reach our goal of predicting the opponents cards, next move or as a minimum what strength their dealt hand has. A big advantage is that by using a neural network we can model a player throughout the game. First the neural network of course take many inputs but one of them would be about a specific player and their history, the choices they made, their chips, cards etc. From that the neural network will continue to receive inputs about the player so that the player modeling can be dynamic.
Another big advantage of a neural network is that we are able to give a lot of inputs. These inputs will then be weighted by the system in order to come closer to our targeted output.
This will help us cut out all of the noise that occur and leave us with data that is relevant.

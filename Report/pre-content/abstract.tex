Poker is a game which have a lot of different aspects which makes it a very interesting game to implement artificial intelligence (AI) into.
The game is unlike games like chess and backgammon as poker has the problem that the information is imperfect. This is also one of the reasons why poker is interesting topic in regards to artificial intelligence as it opens up for some problematics as how to handle the information we have in regards to what we do not have. 
Because of this hidden information there are many decision to decide from, as we have to take into account all the information that we have access to and the possible information which is hidden from us.
Another thing that makes poker interesting to have a look at is that we now have opponents who has the opportunity to trick us into thinking that he is in another state than what he actually is.
In this bachelor thesis we will present a way to implement a neural network in a poker game to teach the bots how to play Texas Holdâ€™em Poker.
The neural network will keep evolving along the opponents to ensure that the bot has the best possible chances of winning or minimize the loses.
We will test the bots against real life human players in many suitable situations and from these results we can determine how effective our neural network is at teaching our bots how to play the game.

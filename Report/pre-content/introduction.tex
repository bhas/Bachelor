\section*{Introduction}
Being a good poker player requires that one are able to adapt to opponents and decide when it will be beneficial to play aggressive, defensive or fold. In order to do that one must take a lot of different inputs into consideration such as cards dealt, chips, opponents strategy etc. a lot of these inputs will be hidden and not available to the player during most of the game.

In the games of poker a perfect player will never be anything more than a theoretical term. Such a player would have to be able to know all the information about the game including the hidden information so basically read the opponents mind and the future. We think of the perfect player as an unreachable goal instead.

To overcome the challenge about the hidden information players will instead make some decisions based on qualified guesses. They will try to figure out the opponents strategy based on prior actions and use statistics to calculate the odds of winning.

This thesis will focus on the design and implementation of artificial intelligence in poker. Our poker bot is targeted to Texas Hold'em Limit. We will make use of existing algorithms such as neural networks and Monte Carlo Simulation.

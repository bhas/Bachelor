The game of poker is already a pretty complex game, put that together with artificial intelligence and you have a situation that is very challenging. To create an AI player that is producing good results against other players bring many problematics along the way. As far as implementing some artificial intelligence we are facing problems regarding the hidden information which is our opponents cards. Furthermore deception, and how many players we are playing against will also be obstacles that we will have to overcome.
 If we want to produce the best possible results we will have to player model each of the players that we are playing against, to make sure that the bots gameplay will be the most optimal, considering all the opponents and their gameplay.
One of the reasons why it is necessary to player model every player is because we need to have the opportunity to exploit a weak player. If one keeps making weak moves that we can predict it would be a wise consideration to exploit this and beat the player. 
Even if we are playing a game of poker there will always good ways of handling each situation and thereby each opponent in the best way possible. The best players in the world are very efficient at adapting to each and every player of the board, even if the opponents changes their gameplay throughout the game, one must be able to adapt to this to be able to beat them.

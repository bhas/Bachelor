In this thesis we investigate, how we can implement an adaptable poker agent. 

We found that the strength of a poker hand can be found as the probability of winning with that hand. We have developed a subsystem that can calculate an estimate of the true probability with a maximum error of one percent and a calculation time of $\sim$0,15 seconds.

In order to develop the strategy we first designed an artificial neural network to observe and learn the strategy of human poker players. We found this approach to be successful to some extend. The artificial neural network did manage to improve during learning, but it did not manage to fully learn a strategy. We believe this was because of our dataset, as it was not appropriate for the artificial neural network. 
Using the strategy found by the artificial neural network, the adaptive poker agent was not able to win against another simple poker bot.

Finally we reflected upon how we could have extended the strategy of the adaptive poker agent to also adapt to the opponents. We found that using player modelling is a viable option which has a lot of potential.
